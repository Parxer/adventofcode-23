Advent of Code 2023 solutions; written in Rust (which I'm trying to learn)

## How to set up:
- Create an .env file by copying and renaming .env.example
- input your AoC2023 session cookie (visible in the network tab in your browser when opening your personalized input)
- if you want to see debug output for your regular input (which is gonna be a _lot_ of text), add a `AOC_DEBUG` env variable and set it to whatever (must have any value)

## How to use:
- Run unit tests to verify against sample inputs
- Run normally to fetch & process your actual input
